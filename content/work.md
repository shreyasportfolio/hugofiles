I have supported several NASA initiatives to evaluate the efficiency of NAS operations by designing a Fuel Burn model to estimate flight time, fuel consumption, and flight segment operating costs for all airline flights in the NAS. I was also involved in algorithm design and business logic development of various other NASA projects at Robust Analytics such as a Terminal Area Hidden Markov Risk Model, simulation and modeling of passenger behavior in airport premises, and projects related to the NASA SMART NAS Test Bed (SNTB). Some topics I enjoy working on:

* Air Transportation Management 
* Modeling and Simulation
* Optimization, optimization, optimization
* Aircraft design
* Airline Operating center tools
* Algorithm Development
* Hackathons and Volunteer work
